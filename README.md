 This Streamlit application transforms the traditional QBR process by automating the generation of standardized, data-driven business reviews using Snowflake's native LLM capabilities. The app addresses two critical challenges in sales organizations:  Creating consistent, reliable QBR presentations for management Eliminating the time-intensive QBR preparation process for account executives. This app combines real-time metrics, historical data, and AI-powered analysis to generate comprehensive QBRs through an intuitive interface. Users can customize outputs through multiple templates (Executive, Technical, Customer Success, Sales) while maintaining standardization across the organization.  It also leverages vector similarity search for contextual relevance and provides structured outputs covering executive summaries, business impact, product adoption, and strategic recommendations - all without requiring manual data compilation or presentation creation from the sales team.
