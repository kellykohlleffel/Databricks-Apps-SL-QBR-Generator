# Enterprise QBR Generator
 The Enterprise QBR Generator transforms the traditional QBR process by automating the generation of standardized, data-driven business reviews using Fivetran, Pinecone and Databricks. The app addresses two critical challenges in sales organizations:  Creating consistent, reliable QBR presentations for management and eliminating the time-intensive QBR preparation process for account executives. The app combines sales data, support data, product data, current metrics, and predictive insights to create instant, standardardized and actionable QBRs through an intuitive interface. Users can customize outputs through multiple templates (Sales, Executive, Technical, Customer Success) while maintaining standardization across the organization.  It also leverages vector similarity search for contextual relevance and provides predictable outputs covering executive summaries, business impact, product adoption, and strategic recommendations - all without requiring manual effort or presentation creation from the sales team or management team.
